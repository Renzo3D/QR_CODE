# QR_CODE


This is a code that help you create QR codes. Everytime you time you time or erase something the QR code gets updated. This is a code a found online and I used as a practice.


It will help me create barcodes for my future projects and even resume. 


Google infographic is use to create this QR code but it is not recommend by google not to use it since it has been deprecated.
